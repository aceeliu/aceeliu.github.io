There are only 2 ways to succeed for a non-PhD like me:

1. Climb up the Corporate ladder (probably need to get a MBA)
2. Join a Startup as a founding engineer

"Play to your strengths and become someone they can't replace."

"Leverage your core strengths and make yourself indispensable."

Always do the hard and right things, important and not urgent things.
